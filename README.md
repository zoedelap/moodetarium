# moodetarium
This project is created for the Coding and the Arts class at The University of Tulsa. It is an Augmented Reality display that interacts with data collected from the [corresponding website](https://ineffablezoe.wixsite.com/moodetarium/). The project is designed to create a sense of community among TU students from differing academic backgrounds.
